-- ===================================================
-- POLICY: organization_invites_update
-- ---------------------------------------------------
-- Allows users to update rows in the `organization_invites` table
-- under strict conditions:
--
-- 1. Admins can update invites for their organization.
-- 2. Invite recipients can accept their own invite,
--    if it's not expired, revoked, or already accepted.
--
-- The `with check` clause ensures:
-- - Only owners can promote others to admin.
-- - The accepting user is the intended recipient.
-- - Tier limits (e.g., member caps) are enforced on acceptance.
-- - Only admins can revoke invites.
-- - Delivery fields (status, logs) are system-managed and must remain unchanged.
